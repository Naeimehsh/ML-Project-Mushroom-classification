## ML-Project-Mushroom-classification
### This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous based on specific attributes, including the shape and color of the cap, the color of the gills, and more.

I completed this project during my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS CODING SCHOOL.

### The repository includes the following folders:

- Code
- Datasets (this dataset can be used for model development)
- My_Model_prediction

Finally, here you can submit and see how your model works: [Link to Streamlit app](https://mushrooms-win.streamlit.app/) :smiley:
