## ML-Project-Mushroom-classification
### This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous based on specific attributes, including the shape and color of the cap, the color of the gills, and more.

I completed this project during my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS CODING SCHOOL.
